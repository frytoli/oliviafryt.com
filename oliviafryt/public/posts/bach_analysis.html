            ABC's The Bachelor franchise is arguably the most notorious romance reality television shows to ever exist. Accordign to KQED, throughout its history average viewership has fluctuated between 8 and 13 million viewers. Why are these shows so well-watched?
  There's no doubt that the cheesy tag lines, dramatic contestant feuds, and palpable sense of shallowness in part keeps watchers' eyes glued to their screens, exclaiming, glass of wine in hand, at the twists and frustrations in each episode. In this most recent season
  of The Bachelorette, Clare Crawley picked and got engaged to a contestant <b>two weeks</b> after her season started. This got me thinking... I wonder if there is a correlation between a contestant's general physical attractiveness and the week of their elimination.
  I mean, that's got to be it right? My assumption is that the more attractive a contestant the later they are eliminated. Because there's no way Clare picked Dale because of his personality -- because she didn't even know him! Luckily this inquiry coincided perfectly
  with the timing of one of my grad school course's final projects. To wrap up my semester, I set out to see if a correlation exists between contestants' facial attractiveness and their "place" (based off of the week of their elimination) OR (for funsies) their
  popularity/engagement on the ever-popular social media platform Instagram.
